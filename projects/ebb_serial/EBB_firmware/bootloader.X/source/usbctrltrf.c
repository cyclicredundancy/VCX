*********************************************************************
For a control transfer read, if the host tries to read more data
than what it has requested, the peripheral device should stall the
extra IN transactions and the status stage. Typically, a host does
not try to read more data than what it has requested. The original
firmware did not handle this situation. Instead of stalling extra
IN transactions, the device kept sending out zero length packets.

The new variable introduced is used to keep track if a short IN
packet has been sent or not. From this the state machine can
decide if it should stall future extra IN transactions or not.

 * Overview:        This routine is a task dispatcher and has 3 stages.
 *                  1. It initializes the control transfer state machine.
 *                  2. It calls on each of the module that may know how to
 *                     service the Setup Request from the host.
 *                     Module Example: USB9, HID, CDC, MSD, ...
 *                     As new classes are added, ClassReqHandler table in
 *                     usbdsc.c should be updated to call all available
 *                     class handlers.
 *                  3. Once each of the modules has had a chance to check if
 *                     it is responsible for servicing the request, stage 3
 *                     then checks direction of the transfer to determine how
 *                     to prepare EP0 for the control transfer.
 *                     Refer to USBCtrlEPServiceComplete() for more details.
 *
 * Note:            Microchip USB Firmware has three different states for
 *                  the control transfer state machine:
 *                  1. WAIT_SETUP
 *                  2. CTRL_TRF_TX
 *                  3. CTRL_TRF_RX
 *                  Refer to firmware manual to find out how one state
 *                  is transitioned to another.
 *
 *                  A Control Transfer is composed of many USB transactions.
 *                  When transferring data over multiple transactions,
 *                  it is important to keep track of data source, data
 *                  destination, and data count. These three parameters are
 *                  stored in pSrc,pDst, and wCount. A flag is used to
 *                  note if the data source is from ROM or RAM.

Bug Fix: May 14, 2007 (#F3)
*********************************************************************
In the original firmware, if an IN token is sent by the host
before a SETUP token is sent, the firmware would respond with an ACK.
This is not a correct response, the firmware should have sent a STALL.
This is a minor non-compliance since a compliant host should not
send an IN before sending a SETUP token. The fix allows a SETUP
transaction to be accepted while stalling IN transactions.

Although this fix is known, it is not implemented because it
breaks the #AF1 fix in USBCtrlEPServiceComplete().
Since #AF1 fix is more important, this fix, #F3 is commented out.
