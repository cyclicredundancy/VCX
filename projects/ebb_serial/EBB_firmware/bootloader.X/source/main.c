/*********************************************************************
IMPORTANT NOTE: This code is currently configured to work with the
PIC18F46J50 FS USB Demo Board.  It can be readily adapted to
work with other members of the PIC18F46J50 Family of USB microcontrollers 
as well (PIC18F24J50/25J50/26J50/44J50/45J50/46J50).

To do so, modify the linker script for the appropriate FILES includes,
and the new memory ranges (assuming a different memory size device), and
click "Configure --> Select Device" and select the proper
microcontroller.  Also double check to verify that the io_cfg.h and
usbcfg.h are properly configured to match your desired application
platform.

It is also recommended to configure the default I/O pin usage in this code.
See the InitializeSystem() function.

This code is meant to be compiled with the C18 compiler version 3.22+
with all optimizations turned on.  If some of the optimizations are not
enabled, the total code size may grow to exceed the 0x000-0xFFF memory
region this code is designed to occupy.  In this case, linker errors will
occur.  If this happens, the vector remapping in the _entry() function 
will have to be modified, as will the application firmware projects that 
may get programmed using this bootloader firmware (to have an entry
point higher than 0x1000).  Additionally, the linker script in this
project will have to be modified to make the BootPage section larger.
*********************************************************************/


//----------------------------------------------------
//Usage tips for this HID USB bootloader firwmare
//----------------------------------------------------

//To enter this bootloader firmware, hold the RB2 I/O pin low at power
//up or after a reset.  Alternatively, application firmware may enter
//the bootloader firmware by clearing the INTCON<GIE> bit and then
//executing an "_asm goto 0x001C _endasm" instruction.

//If a high priority interrupt occurs, the PC will jump to 0x1008
//If a low priority interrupt occurs, the PC will jump to 0x1018

//If RB2 is high at power up/after reset, this code will jump to
//the application firmware, instead of staying in this bootloader firmware.
//The start of the application firmware should be at 0x1000
//In other words, when developing the application firmware which will be
//programmed with this bootloader, place the following in the code, if
//it is a C18 based project:

//extern void _startup (void);    // See c018i.c in your C18 compiler dir
//#pragma code AppFirmwareStartLocation = 0x1000
//void _reset (void)
//{
//    _asm goto _startup _endasm
//}

//Build the application project with a linker script that marks
//the address range 0x000-0xFFF as "PROTECTED".  This is the program
//memory region that this bootloader is currently configured to occupy.

//Although the bootloader can re-program the program memory page that
//contains the configuration bits (the last page of implemented flash)
//it is not always preferrable to do so in case a user attempts to
//program a hex file with configuration bit settings that are not compatible
//with USB operation.  This would prevent further entry into the bootloader.
//If the bootloader will not be used to program the configuration
//words page, the application firmware's linker script should mark
//the entire page as PROTECTED.

//	The USB specifications require that USB peripheral devices must never source

//	current on D+ or D- when the host/hub is not actively powering the Vbus line.
//	When designing a self powered (as opposed to bus powered) USB peripheral
//	device, the firmware should make sure not to turn on the USB module and D+
//	or D- pull up resistor unless Vbus is actively powered.  Therefore, the
//	firmware needs some means to detect when Vbus is being powered by the host.
//	A 5V tolerant I/O pin can be connected to Vbus (through a resistor), and
// 	can be used to detect when Vbus is high (host actively powering), or low
//	(host is shut down or otherwise not supplying power).  The USB firmware
// 	can then periodically poll this I/O pin to know when it is okay to turn on
//	the USB module/D+/D- pull up resistor.  When designing a purely bus powered
//	peripheral device, it is not possible to source current on D+ or D- when the
//	host is not actively providing power on Vbus. Therefore, implementing this
//	bus sense feature is optional.  This firmware can be made to use this bus
//	sense feature by making sure "USE_USB_BUS_SENSE_IO" has been defined in the

//	self and bus powered, it should not return a hard coded value for this request.
//	Instead, firmware should check if it is currently self or bus powered, and
//	respond accordingly.  If the hardware has been configured like demonstrated
