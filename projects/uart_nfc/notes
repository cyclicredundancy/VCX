Streaming Frame decoding

keep on reading bytes till we get a 00 followed FF
from: preamble 
to: start of packet code

    if next two bytes 00 followed by FF
    then: its an ACK frame
    next bytes should be the postamble
    
    if next two bytes are FF followed by 00
    then: its a NACK frame
    next bytes should be the postabmle

    LEN - length of TFI and PD

    LCS - length checksum

    TFI - direction of frame, sent from host or PN532. D4=>host D5=>PN532

    DATA - PD0 to PDn

    DCS - TFI and DATA checksum

    POSTABMLE
